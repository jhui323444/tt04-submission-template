# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  description:  "2 4-bit adders for use on a vector register"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      It is two 4-bit adders stacked together so that an 8-bit vector register is able to perform a simd vector addition. The inputs 0-3 are for data1 and inputs 4-7 are for data2; outputs are the same.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Load vector-register1 into the input ports, and then step the clk to store the value in the ASIC's internal register. Then load vector-register2 into the input ports. 
      The output should be the vector-sum of the two inputs.
